# Battle of the Neighborhoods - Week 1 

The Battle of the Neighborhoods - Week 1
Introduction & Business Problem :

Toronto is often referred to as "New York City run by the Swiss." The department of tourism says that you can find world-class theater, shopping and restaurants in Toronto. So if someone was to open a business in Toronto where should the open the business and what is the most popular type of venue/business to open in each of Toronto's Boroughs. 

Data

In order to open a business we will need to consider:
Population
Demographics
What are the popular venues?
Who is the competition in that location?
Segmentation of the Borough
Untapped markets or Saturated markets 

When we consider all these problems, we can create a map and information chart for Toronto which will show each borough which  is clustered according to the venue density. I will also use cluster analysis on Foursquare location data to assist a new business owner with identifying potential neighborhoods that are nor over-saturated for the particular venue type thus being a potentially viable locations for their new venture.
